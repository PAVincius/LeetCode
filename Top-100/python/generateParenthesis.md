# Explanation

## Class Definition
We define a class Solution with a method generateParenthesis.

## Method Signature
The method generateParenthesis takes an integer n and returns a list of strings.

## Backtracking Function
Inside the method, we define a nested function backtrack which helps in generating the combinations.

## Parameters:
s: Current string being built.
left: Count of opening parentheses used so far.
right: Count of closing parentheses used so far.
Base Case
If the length of s is 2 * n, it means we have used all pairs of parentheses, and the string is well-formed. We add it to the result list.

## Recursive Calls
If left < n, we can add an opening parenthesis and recursively call backtrack.
If right < left, we can add a closing parenthesis and recursively call backtrack.
Result List
We initialize an empty list result to store the valid combinations and return it after the backtracking completes.

This approach ensures that we only generate valid combinations of well-formed parentheses by maintaining the balance between opening and closing parentheses throughout the process.
