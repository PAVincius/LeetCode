# Explanation:
Backtracking Function: The backtrack function is defined to explore combinations starting from a given index (start), with a remaining target (target), and the current path (path).

# Base Cases:
If target == 0, it means the current combination sums up to the target, so we add it to the result list.
If target < 0, it means the current combination exceeds the target, so we stop exploring this path.

# Recursive Exploration:
We iterate over the candidates starting from the start index to avoid duplicate combinations (e.g., [2, 2, 3] and [3, 2, 2]).
For each candidate, we include it in the current path and recursively call backtrack with the updated target (target - candidates[i]) and the new path (path + [candidates[i]]).

# Result Collection: The result list collects all valid combinations that sum up to the target.
This approach ensures that we explore all possible combinations while avoiding duplicates by always moving forward in the candidate list.
