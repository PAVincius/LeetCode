## Bit Manipulation Approach:

The core idea behind using bit manipulation to find all subsets (the power set) of a set with `n` elements is that there are $2^n$ possible subsets. Each of these subsets can be uniquely represented by a **bitmask** of length `n`.

* **`n`**: This variable stores the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
* **`result`**: This list is initialized to be empty and will store all the generated subsets.
* **Bitmask Representation**: For each element in `nums`, we have two choices: either it's part of a particular subset, or it's not. This binary choice can be represented by a single bit:
    * `1` signifies that the element is included in the subset.
    * `0` signifies that the element is excluded from the subset.
    If `nums` has `n` elements, then a sequence of `n` bits (forming a bitmask) can represent one unique subset. For instance, if `nums = [1, 2, 3]` (so `n=3`):
    * The mask `000` (integer 0) corresponds to the empty set `[]`.
    * The mask `001` (integer 1) corresponds to the set `[nums[0]]` (e.g., `[1]`).
    * The mask `010` (integer 2) corresponds to the set `[nums[1]]` (e.g., `[2]`).
    * The mask `101` (integer 5) corresponds to the set `[nums[0], nums[2]]` (e.g., `[1, 3]`).
    * This continues up to `111` (integer 7), which corresponds to `[nums[0], nums[1], nums[2]]` (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).

### `subsets` Function Logic:

1.  **Determine `n`**:
    * `n = len(nums)`: First, we find the number of elements in the input list.

2.  **Initialize `result`**:
    * `result = []`: An empty list is created to store all the subsets we will generate.

3.  **Iterate Through All Possible Masks**:
    * `for i in range(1 << n):`: The outer loop iterates from `i = 0` up to $2^n - 1$. The expression `1 << n` is a bitwise way to calculate $2^n$. Each value of `i` in this loop represents a unique bitmask for one of the $2^n$ possible subsets.

4.  **Construct Each Subset Based on its Mask (`i`)**:
    * `subset = []`: Inside the outer loop, for each mask `i`, an empty list `subset` is created. This list will be populated with elements from `nums` based on the bits set in `i`.
    * `for j in range(n):`: An inner loop iterates from `j = 0` to `n-1`. The variable `j` serves as an index for both the elements in `nums` (i.e., `nums[j]`) and the bit positions in the mask `i` (i.e., the `j`-th bit).
        * **Check the `j`-th Bit**:
            * `if (i >> j) & 1:`: This is the key bit manipulation step.
                * `i >> j`: This expression right-shifts the bits of the mask `i` by `j` positions. This effectively moves the `j`-th bit of `i` to the rightmost position (the least significant bit, or LSB).
                * `& 1`: This performs a bitwise AND operation between the shifted value and `1` (binary `...0001`). The result is `1` if the LSB (which was originally the `j`-th bit of `i`) is `1`, and `0` otherwise.
        * **Add Element to Subset**:
            * `subset.append(nums[j])`: If the `j`-th bit of `i` is `1`, it signifies that the element `nums[j]` should be included in the current `subset`, so it's appended.

5.  **Store the Constructed Subset**:
    * `result.append(subset)`: After the inner loop completes (meaning all `n` bit positions for the current mask `i` have been checked), the fully constructed `subset` is added to the `result` list.

6.  **Return All Subsets**:
    * `return result`: Once the outer loop finishes (all $2^n$ masks have been processed), the `result` list, now containing all possible subsets, is returned.

### Initialization:

* The primary initialization involves setting up `n` based on the input `nums` and an empty `result` list. The process then directly iterates through numerical representations of bitmasks ($0$ to $2^n-1$), and for each mask, it constructs the corresponding subset. No complex pre-computation or auxiliary data structures for state tracking (like in some recursive backtracking algorithms) are needed beyond the `subset` list that is rebuilt for each mask.
